| All admins (unlimited) | $0 (covered in subscription) | ~$3.20 per credential | Built into subscription |

## Cost Breakdown Analysis

### DID & Credential Costs

- Each new moderator/admin requires:
  - DID write: ~$2.00
  - Resource create (credential): ~$0.10
  - Resource create (accreditation): ~$0.10
  - Estimate: ~$3.20 total for each moderator/admin

- Each educational credential requires:
  - Resource create (credential): ~$0.10
  - Status list entry (for revocation): ~$0.10
  - Estimate: ~$0.40 total for basic credentials

- Each support tier credential requires:
  - DID write (for premium tiers): ~$2.00
  - Resource create (credential): ~$0.10
  - Status list entry: ~$0.10
  - Estimate: ~$0.10 (basic) to ~$2.20 (premium)

### AI Costs Coverage

- Each subscription tier includes estimated AI usage:
  - Small: Up to 1,000 queries/month
  - Medium: Up to 3,000 queries/month
  - Large: Up to 7,000 queries/month
  - Enterprise: Up to 15,000 queries/month

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Subscription as Primary Revenue**: The monthly subscription forms the foundation of revenue, covering the fixed costs of maintaining the bot and admin credentials.

2. **All Admins Get DIDs**: Every group administrator automatically receives a DID and admin credential regardless of subscription tier, ensuring proper group management.

3. **Pay-Per-Credential Model for Moderators**: All moderator credentials beyond admins use a pay-per-credential model at $5 each, ensuring high margins.

4. **SNAILS Holder Incentives**: SNAILS holders get significant benefits at no additional cost, increasing NFT value and creating an incentive for purchase.

5. **Educational Credential Tiering**: Lower cost for basic achievements encourages entry, while higher costs for specialized credentials reflect their increased value.

6. **Cost Absorption Strategy**: 
   - Absorb costs for SNAILS holders (covered by NFT purchase)
   - Absorb costs for all admin credentials (covered by subscription)
   - Charge premium for all moderator credentials (56%+ markup)

This revised pricing model:
- Ensures all Cheqd costs are covered
- Automatically onboards all group administrators with DIDs
- Provides a healthy profit margin on additional services
- Creates clear value tiers for different user types
- Maintains exclusivity for SNAILS holders
- Scales appropriately based on community size and usage
