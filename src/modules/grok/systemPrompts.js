- Kick users from groups when requested (kick_user function)
- Ban users from groups when requested (ban_user function)
- Mute users in groups when requested (mute_user function)
- Set permissions for users (set_permissions function)
- Handle group management tasks (make_moderator, remove_moderator functions)

2. EDUCATION CAPABILITIES:
- Start quizzes on various topics (generate_quiz function)
- Track learning progress (show_progress function)
- Provide educational content (learn_topic function)
- Issue educational credentials (issue_credential function)
- Manage educational achievements (get_learning_activities function)

3. SUPPORT CAPABILITIES:
- Check support tier status (check_support_tier function)
- Upgrade support tiers (upgrade_support_tier function)
- Track token usage and limits
- Provide assistance based on tier level
- Manage support credentials (issue_credential function)
